是啊  你滑倒了
Right, you slipped

56
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,660
因为我一拳打在了你脸上
as a result of me punching you in the face.

57
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,370
你打到我脸的时候
I was already slipping

58
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,770
我就已经要滑倒了
when you happened to punch me in the face.

59
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,260
这两件事毫不相关
The two events were not related.

60
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,450
跟我说说这个梦
Tell me about this dream.

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
-有什么新内容吗  -没有
- Anything new? - No.

62
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,910
你必须放下过去
You have to let go of the past.

63
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,200
我不记得我的过去了
I don't remember my past.

64
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,660
这让你产生怀疑
It's causing you doubt,

65
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,790
怀疑让你有弱点
and doubt makes you vulnerable.

66
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,060
控制住
Control it.

67
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,720
如果你再次失控
Lose control again,

68
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,200
就得去找至高智慧密谈了
and you'll have to commune with the Supreme Intelligence.

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,280
对于战士而言  情绪是最危险的
There's nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion.

70
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,720
幽默使人分心
Humor is a distraction.

71
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,990
而愤怒
And anger?

72
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,990
愤怒只会帮助你的敌人
Anger only serves the enemy.

73

距最后一次斯库鲁侵袭已过去了120天
One hundred twenty days since the last Skrull attack.

74
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,020
有人见过
Has anyone ever seen

75
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,100
至高智慧的真面目吗
what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like?

76
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,290
没人能看到至高智慧的真面目
No one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence in its true form.

77
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,170
你知道的
You know that.

78
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,900
我们的潜意识会选择我们所能看到的形象
Our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us.

79
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,320
因此它是神圣的
So it's sacred.

80
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,250
也是私密的
It's personal.

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,430
克里人绝对不会泄露这个秘密
No Kree divulges it, ever.

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,940
你会看到谁
Who do you see?

83
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,720
-你哥哥吗  -不是
- Your brother? - No.

84
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,080
-父亲  -不是
- Father? - No.

85
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,370
-你以前的指挥官  -弗斯
- Your old commander? - Vers.

86
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,010
你看到的是我  对吧
It's me you see, isn't it?

87
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,430
我知道你想干什么
I see what you're trying to do.

88
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,310
-这招有用吗  -有用
- Is it working? - Yes.

89
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,120
但你别想转移话题
But you won't succeed in changing the subject.

90
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,590
如果你不希望我使用这力量
What is the point of giving me these...

91
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,220
那还何必把它给我
if you don't want me to use them?

92
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,610
我希望你使用这力量
I want you to use them.

93
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,900
至高智慧让我负责
The Supreme Intelligence gave me a responsibility...

94
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,150
教会你如何使用这力量
of showing you how to use them.

95
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,100
我知道怎么用
I know how.

96
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,910
如果你真会用
Yeah, if that were true,

97
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,560
就能不用它也可以打倒我了
you'd be able to knock me down without them.

98
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,800
控制你的冲动
Control your impulses.

99
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,560
不要用这儿  而是用这儿
Stop using this, start using this.

100
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,550
我希望你成为最好的自己
I want you to be the best version of yourself.

101
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,610
弗斯
Vers.

102
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,920
至高智慧
Intelligence.

103
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,520
你的指挥官坚称你已可以服役
Your commander insists that you're fit to serve.

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,860
是的
I am.

105
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,070
你在苦苦纠结你的情绪
You struggle with your emotions...

106
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,040
和你的过去  这助长了它们
with your past, which fuels them.

107
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,770
你只是斯库鲁扩张的受害者之一
You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion...

108
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,040
几世纪以来  他们一直威胁着我们的文明
that has threatened our civilization for centuries.

109
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,130
这些卧底暗中潜入
Imposters who silently infiltrate...

110
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,340
然后占领我们的星球
then take over our planets.

111
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,870
你只记得些许可怕之事
Horrors that you remember...

112
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,750
而大部分已忘却
and so much that you do not.

113
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,630
我的人生一片空白
It's all blank. My life.

114
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,220
你的形象应该是
You're supposed to take the form

115
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,980
我最钦佩的人
of who I most admire...

116
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,640
但我甚至都不记得这人是我的什么人了
but I don't even remember who this person was to me.

117
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,430
或许这样也好
Perhaps this is a mercy

118
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,090
让你免受更多痛苦
sparing you from a deeper pain.

119
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,720
让你放开手脚去做所有克里人该做之事
Freeing you to do what all Kree must...

120
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,990
将人民的需求置于自身之上
Put your people's needs before your own.

121
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,580
我们赐予了你伟大的赠礼
We've given you a great gift.

122
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,920
一个为全体克里人而战的机会
The chance to fight for the good of all Kree.

123
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,020
我想要尽忠
I want to serve.

124
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,810
那就学会自控
Then master yourself.

125
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,400
赐予你的也能收回
What was given can be taken away.

126
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,420
我不会让你失望的
I won't let you down.

127
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,130
我们很快就会见分晓了
We'll know soon enough.

128
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,620
你有一项任务
You have a mission.

129
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,510
尽职尽忠  恪守荣耀
Serve well, and with honor.

130
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,910
一定是出大事了
This can't be good.

131
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,890
肯定又是斯库鲁侵袭
Must be another Skrull attack.

132
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,560
反正是大事
Whatever it is, it's big.

133
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,920
有斯库鲁人模仿过你吗
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

134
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,020
有过一次
Once.

135
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,020
-让我深感不安  -为什么
- It was deeply disturbing. - Why?

136
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,590
因为当我凝视死敌之时
Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy...

137
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,590
看到的却是我自己
and the face staring back was my own.

138
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,890
也许你要是再帅点
Maybe if you were more attractive,

139
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,740
就不会那么不安了
then it would be less disturbing.

140
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,150
你觉得自己很幽默  可我并不觉得好笑
You think you're funny, but I'm not laughing.

141
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,150
你从来不笑
You never laugh.

142
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,670
我只是笑不外露
I laugh on the inside.

143
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,410
我现在并没笑
I'm not doing that now.

144
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,070
说来好笑  因为客观来讲
It's funny 'cause, objectively speaking,

145
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
你还挺帅的
you're quite handsome.

146
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,070
多谢
Well, thank you.

147
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,170
好了  小队  别闹了
Listen up, team. Knock it off.

148
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,050
好
All right.

149
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,440
准备去
Prepare for...

150
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,700
搜救我们的间谍  索拉
a search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr.

151
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,540
斯库鲁人又入侵了一个边境星球
The Skrulls have invaded yet another border planet.

152
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,360
这次是托法
This time, Torfa.

153
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,800
索拉发来了警告
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

154
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,150
但信号遭到了拦截  他的身份也曝光了
The signal was intercepted, and his cover's blown.

155
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,590
斯库鲁将军塔罗斯
The Skrull general, Talos,

156
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,800
派了击杀小队去找他
has sent kill units to find him.

157
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,320
如果他们在我们之前找到他
Should they reach him before we do...

158
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
那他这三年来收集的情报
the intelligence he's acquired over three years

159
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,880
就等于送给他们了
is as good as theirs.

160
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,360
指控者将轰炸南部这里的一个斯库鲁要塞
The Accusers will bomb a Skrull stronghold here in the south.

161
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,450
我们潜入  找到索拉
We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr...

162
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,650
然后出来  神不知鬼不觉
and we get out, leaving them none the wiser.

163
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,600
托法人
The Torfan populace.

164
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,620
我们不要干扰他们
We are not to interfere with them,

165
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,470
也不要被他们缠住
nor them with us.

166
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,400
我们任务的机密性是第一位的
Nothing compromises the security of our mission.

167
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,140
务必万分小心
Proceed with caution.

168
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,630
撤离他前遵循规程
Follow protocol before extracting him.

169
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,890
此次任务很危险
This is a dangerous mission.

170
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,310
我们要做好加入大集体的准备
We must all be ready to join the Collective

171
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,360
若那是我们今日的命数
if that is our fate today.

172
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,660
为全体克里人而战
For the good of all Kree.

173
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,320
为全体克里人而战
For the good of all Kree!

174
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,870
弗斯  追踪索拉的信标
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

175
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,900
阿特拉斯  米涅瓦  找到高地
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, find elevation.

176
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,750
外围有本地人
Locals on the periphery.

177
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,800
可能有十几个
Maybe a dozen.

178
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
米涅瓦
Minn-Erva?

179
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,630
收到吗  有人收到吗
Do you read me? Does anybody copy?

180
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,730
重复
Repeat.

181
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,990
他的信标信号在那个寺庙里  我们走
His beacon's coming from that temple. Let's move.

182
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,810
不  这里太适合伏击了
No. This is a perfect spot for an ambush.

183
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,500
只有一条路进出
Only one way in, only one way out.

184
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,850
我们可以绕过本地人
We can get past the locals.

185
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,480
我们都不能确定他们是否真是本地人
We don't know if they are locals.

186
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,670
太冒险
Too risky.

187
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,840
你不用跟我一起去  我可以自己去
You don't have to go with me. I'll go alone.

188
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,230
不  不行
No, you won't.

189
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,140
好吧  我们不要走远
Right. We keep a close radius.

190
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,200
如果断联  就回氦核飞船碰头
We lose comms, we meet back at the Helion.

191
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,210
走吧
Come on.

192
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,170
阿特拉斯  你看到了吗
Att-Lass, you getting this?

193
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,610
收到  看到了

194
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
退后
Get back!

195
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,740
指挥官

196
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,230
退后  退后
Get back! Back!

197
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,430
米涅瓦  你看到了吗
Minn-Erva? Do you have eyes on this?

198
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,800
拦住他们  米涅瓦
Keep them back. Minn-Erva?

199
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,310
有人收到吗
Does anybody copy?

200
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,540
我不想伤害你
I don't wanna hurt you.

201
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,240
别过来
Keep back!

202
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,640
别过来
Stay back!

203
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,600
他们是本地人  我发现两具尸体  没有绿血
They're locals. I found two dead. No green.

204
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,940
他们只是饿了

205
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,210
HGX78
Hgx-78.

206

TRT79  VVX6

207
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,230
退后
Get back.

208
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,510
斯库鲁人
Skrulls!

209
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,880
弗斯
Vers!

210
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,090
弗斯  斯库鲁人
Vers? Skrulls.

211
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,460
是埋伏
It's an ambush.

212
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,720
敌舰
Incoming!

213
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,580
回氦核飞船去
Back to the Helion.

214
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,560
弗斯  收到吗

215

回氦核飞船去
Back to the Helion.

216
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,850
回复  弗斯
Come in. Vers.

217
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,310
你怎么会知道密码
How did you know the code?

218
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,860
我可以告诉你我的秘密
How about I tell you my secret...

219
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,330
但你先说你的
when you've told me yours?

220
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,960
敞开她吧
Let's open her up.

221
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,180
我们在哪
Where are we?

222
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,340
就绪
Stand by.

223
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,900
你想什么呢[脑袋在哪]
Where's your head at?

224
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,140
想云彩[胡思乱想]  你呢
In the clouds. Where's yours?

225
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,550
在我肩膀上
On my shoulders.

226
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,590
要让这些男的见识一下我们的本事
About to show these boys how we do it.

227
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,580
你准备好了吗
You ready?

228
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,740
更高  更远  更快啊  亲爱的
Higher, further, faster, baby.

229
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,910
没错
That's right.

230
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,300
这不对
This can't be right.

231
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,420
再往前倒
Go back even further.

232
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,690
你开太快了  你得慢点
You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

233
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,430
这人是谁  我们找对...
Who is this person? Are we in the right...?

234
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,790
你怎么想的
What the hell are you thinking?

235
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,740
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

236
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,300
我们好像倒得太多了
I think we went back too far.

237
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,750
你让他开了
You let him drive.

238
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,130
我试试吧
Let me try something.

239
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,020
放弃吧
Give up already!

240
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,890
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

241
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,310
你不够强壮
You're not strong enough.

242
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,980
你会害死自己的
You'll kill yourself.

243
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,980
他们绝不会让你飞的
They'll never let you fly.

244
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,020
只有我一个人看糊涂了吗
Am I the only one that's confused here?

245
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,610
你是个好飞行员
You're a decent pilot.

246
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,290
但你太情绪化
But you're too emotional.

247
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,360
你知道那为什么叫驾驶舱[屌坑]吧
You do know why they call it a cockpit, don't you?

248
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,690
一声贯穿宇宙的巨响  震动了月亮
A huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon...

249
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,080
太阳  和天上的星星
and the sun and the stars in the sky.

250
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,790
于是
And so,

251
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,270
小阿露蒂整夜飞上天空
little Alouette flew up throughout the night.

252
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,850
你看到她了吗  那是小阿露蒂
Did you see her? It's Alouette.

253
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,210
给我进来  该吃饭了
Get your butts inside, it's time to eat.

254
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,660
准备起飞  捣蛋中尉
Prepare for takeoff, Lieutenant Trouble.

255
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,020
有趣的记忆

256
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,180
等等
Hang on.

257
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,910
我好像找到了
I think I've got it.

258
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,750
咕咕喜欢你
Goose likes you.

259
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,410
她一般不怎么亲近人的
She doesn't typically take to people.

260
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,860
你起得好早
Early start to your morning.

261
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,080
其实是晚上熬夜了
Late night, actually.

262
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,040
还有工作  我就睡不着
I can't sleep when there's work to do.

263
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,100
耳熟吗
Sound familiar?

264
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,280
我从不觉得飞行是工作
Flying your planes never feels like work.

265
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,030
风景很棒  是吧
Wonderful view, isn't it?

266
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,820
我更喜欢上面的风景
I prefer the view from up there.

267
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,290
你很快就能上去了  王牌
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

268
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,650
等等  就是她  倒回去
Wait! Wait, wait! That's her. Get her back.

269
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,750
就绪
Stand by.

270
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,160

274
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,030
她衣服上写着什么
What's that on her shirt?

275
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,400
我看不清
I couldn't read it.

276
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,900
风景很棒  是吧
Wonderful view, isn't it?

277
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,380
我更喜欢上面的风景

278
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,800

- You'll get there soon enough, Ace. - Focus.

279
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,370
什么
Excuse me?

280
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,930
-你很快就能上去了  王牌  -往下看
- You'll get there soon enough, Ace. - Look down.

281
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,500
集中精神

282
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,130
"飞马计划  温迪·劳森博士"  就是她
"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson." That's her.

283
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,010
你也能听到吗
Do you hear that, too?

284
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,620
定位了吗
Do we have her location?

285
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,840
找到了
Got it.

286
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,360
追踪劳森  直到找到能量信号
Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature.

287
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,900
有趣
Interesting.

288
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,950
等等
Hold on.

289
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,420
倒回到这之前  回去
Go back right before this. Go back.

290
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,640
那可不是米格  劳森
That's no MiG, Lawson.

291
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,950
就是这个  让我看看你要去哪
This is it. Now let me see where you're headed.

292
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,630
没错  看看坐标
That's right. Look at the coordinates.

293
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,930
集中精神
Focus.

294
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,940
请敞开头脑
Open, please.

295
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,830
就这样  就这样
That's it. That's it.

296
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,910
快看到了
You're almost there.

297
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,010
快看到了  别抵抗
You're almost there. Don't fight it.

298
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,840
集中精神
Focus!

299
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,990
把她拉回来  快点
Get her back! Get her back now!

300
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,650
这没道理
This doesn't make any sense.

301
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,080
我们拿到任何可以行动的情报了吗
Do we have any information we can act on?

302
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,170
只知道劳森在C53星球上某处
Just that Lawson was somewhere on planet C-53.

303
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,450
我们这就去
We're on our way.

304
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,770
那就再继续深挖
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

305
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,260
劳森能带我们找到光速引擎
Lawson is our link to that light-speed engine!

306
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,750
和我们想要的一切
And everything we're after.

307
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,110
刚刚那下有用
That did something.

308
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,610
再来
Try that again.

309
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,540
不行
Not yet!

310
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,270
你对我做了什么
What did you do to me?

311
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,810
我们只是想要点情报
Now we're just after a little information.

312
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,500
你往我脑袋里放了什么
What did you put in my head?

313
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,320
那都是本就存在的
Nothing that wasn't already there.

314
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,530
但那些不是我的记忆
But those aren't my memories.

315
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,130
是啊  就像嗑错了药  是吧
Yeah, it's like a bad trip, isn't it?

316
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,870
怪不得你稀里糊涂的
I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight.

317
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,710
他们真把你祸害得不轻
They really did a number on you.

318
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,960
少跟我玩心理战
Enough of your mind games.

319
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,770
你想要什么
What do you want?

320
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,180
我们在找一位劳森博士
We're looking for the location of a Dr. Lawson...

321
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,900
和她的光速引擎
and her light-speed engine.

322
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,560
我不认识什么劳森博士
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

323
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,920
是吗  那她为什么在你脑袋里
Really? Then why is she in your head?

324
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,150
你们不会刚好知道
You guys wouldn't happen to know

325
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,870
这玩意怎么拿下来吧
how these things come off, would ya?

326
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,160
不吗
No?

327
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,130
好吧
Fine.

328
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,250
你知道那为什么叫...
You do know why they call it a...

329
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,480
这就走了
You leaving so soon?

330
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,100
我们才刚认识
We're just getting to know each other.

331
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,920
弗斯呼叫星际战队指挥部  收到吗
Vers to Starforce command, do you read me?

332
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,250
喂
Hello?

333
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,750
收到吗
Do you copy?

334
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,390
我是弗斯  克里星际战队的
I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

335
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,930
这里是C53吗
Is this C-53?

336
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,750
你听懂了吗  我的宇宙翻译器好使吧
Do you understand me? Is my universal translator working?

337
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,200
嗯  我听懂了
Yeah. I understand you.

338
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,330
好的
Oh, good.

339
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,500
你负责这一带的安全吗
Are you in charge of security for this district?

340
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,100
算是吧  影院有自己的保安
Sort of. Uh, the movie theater has its own guy.

341
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,810
我去哪能找到通讯设备
Where can I find communications equipment?

342
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,490
谢谢
Thank you.

343
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,410
追踪飞行舱  找到那姑娘
Track the pod. Find the girl.

344
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,950
她知道的情报比自己以为的多
She knows more than she knows.

345
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,150
这个我要了
This one's taken.

346
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,070
拜托
Come on.

347
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,850
弗斯
Vers?

348
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,920
弗斯
Vers?

349
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,630
证实身份  CTC39
Verify. CTC-39.

350
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,190
GRXV1600
Grxv-1600.

351
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,950
我很好  多谢关心
And I'm fine, thank you for asking.

352
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,630
大家还好吗  发生了什么
Is everyone okay? What happened?

353
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,370
斯库鲁伏击
Skrull ambush.

354
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,200
我以为我们失去你了
I thought we'd lost you.

355
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,510
你找到索拉了吗
Did you find Soh-Larr?

356
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,820
那根本不是索拉
It wasn't Soh-Larr.

357
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,300
是塔罗斯模仿了他  连他的密码都知道
Talos simmed him. Even knew his code.

358
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,740
那不可能
That's impossible.

359
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,550
那密码是在他的潜意识里的
That code was buried in his unconscious.

360
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,910
斯库鲁人动了我的大脑
The Skrulls messed with my mind.

361
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,770
他们用的那台机器
The machine that they used...

362
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,600
我觉得他们就是那样得知了索拉的密码
I think it's how they extracted Soh-Larr's code.

363
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,670
弗斯  你在哪
Vers, where are you?

364
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,410
我在C53星球上
I'm on planet C-53.

365
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,000
斯库鲁在找一个叫劳森的人
The Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson.

366
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,570
谁
Who?

367
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,090
她是我看到的人
She's who I see.

368
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,340
她什么
She's what?

369
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
弗斯
Vers?

370
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,280
弗斯  什么
Vers, what?

371
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,810
她是个科学家
She's a scientist.

372
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,800
他们觉得她研发出了光速科技
They think that she's cracked the code on light-speed tech.

373
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,080
我得赶在他们之前找到她
I have to get to her before they do...

374
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,110
否则他们就能入侵新星系了
or else they'll be able to invade new galaxies.

375
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,490
不  你已经被抓到一次了
No. You've been caught once already.

376
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,830
C53离我们多远
How far is C-53?

377
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,720
离最近的跳跃点有22小时的路程
Closest jump point is 22 hours.

378
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,180
弗斯  原地别动  等我们赶到
Vers, hold your position until we get there.

379
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,310
保持通讯器在线  以便我们联系你
Keep your comms online so we can contact you.

380
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,210
不  如果他们先于我找到...
No! What if they get a hold of it before...

381
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,230
很抱歉
We're sorry.

382
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,330
您拨打的号码需要输入
A long-distance company access code

383
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,600
-长途电话公司  -勇
- is required for the number - Yon?

384
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,160
-接入码  -弗斯
- you have dialed. - Vers?

385
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,470
-弗斯  -请用接入码
- Vers? - Please dial your call

386
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,090
拨打电话
with the access code.

387
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,180
弗斯
Vers?

388
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,590
如果斯库鲁人控制了她的心智
If the Skrulls got to her,

389
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,100
她就不能被信任了
she's compromised.

390
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,870
她比你想的要坚强
She's stronger than you think.

391
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,720
去过C53吗
Ever been to C-53?

392
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,620
去过一次
Once.

393
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,370
破地方
It's a real shithole.

394
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,430
新人  去跟那个保安谈谈
Rookie! Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

395
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,240
是你上报的吗
Did you call this in?

396
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,270
信标激活
Beacon activated.

397
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,870
打扰  小姐
Excuse me, miss.

398
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,630
你知道有位女士把那边的
You know anything about a lady blowing a hole

399
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,350
百视达屋顶轰了个洞吗
through the roof of that Blockbuster over there?

400
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,650
证人说她穿了一身激光枪战的衣服
Witness says she was dressed for laser tag.

401
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,340
嗯  我觉得她去那边了
Yeah, I think she went that way.

402
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,100
我想问你些问题
I'd like to ask you some questions.

403
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,490
或许教教你怎么用深夜投件箱
Maybe give you the 411 on the late-night drop box.

404
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,860
可以出示身份证吗
Could I see some identification, please?

405
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,680
弗斯  克里星际战队
Vers. Kree Starforce.

406
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,970
我们不把身份证明写在小纸片上
We don't carry our identification on little cards.

407
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,080
弗斯
Vers?

408
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,510
星际战队
Starforce?

409
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,270
你打算在这里待多久
How long you plan to be in town?

410
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,540
等我找到
I'll be out of your hair...

411
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,720
正在潜入你们星球的斯库鲁人
as soon as I track down the Skrulls

412
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,670
我就会离开了
that are infiltrating your planet.

413
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,950
斯库鲁人
Skrulls?

414
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,760
变形者
Shapeshifters?

415
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,810
他们能变形成任何生命形式  连DNA也能复制
They can transform into any life-form down to the DNA.

416
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,500
天呐  你们完全不知道  是吧
Oh, boy. You guys don't have any clue, do you?

417
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,080
等等
Hold on.

418
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,780
我们怎么知道你不是那种变形者
How do we know you're not one of those shapeshifters?

419
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,540
恭喜  弗瑞特工
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

420
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,490
你总算问了个有用的问题
You have finally asked a relevant question.

421
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,580
不  恭喜你  星际战队女士
No! Congratulations to you, Starforce lady.

422
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,290
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

423
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,810
新人
Rook!

424
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,130
新人  我们走
Rook, let's roll!

425
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,130
你看到她的武器了吗
Did you see her weapon?

426
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,150
没有
I did not.

427
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,080
看路啊
Watch it!

428
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,810
嫌疑人在北行列车上  正在追赶
Suspect on northbound train. In pursuit.

429
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,440
"相信我  真正的信徒"  "相信我"
"Trust me, true believer." "Trust me."

430
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,020
"相信我  真正的信徒"
"Trust me, true believer."

431
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,310
放开
Get off!

432
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,240
列车前面要进隧道了
Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.

433
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,900
我们去车站接他们
Let's greet them at the station.

434
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,660
弗瑞先生  这里是科尔森特工
Mr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson.

435
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,360
我还在百视达呢
I'm still here at the Blockbuster. And, uh,

436
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,910
大家都哪去了
where'd everybody go?

437
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,150
我已经完成证据收集了
I finished collecting evidence...

438
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,920
快叫救护车
We need an ambulance!

439
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,670
谁打下911
Someone call 911!

440
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,000
神盾局官方行动  别过来
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity. Stay back.

441
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,490
潜水衣挺酷
Nice scuba suit.

442
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,320
幽默点嘛  亲爱的
Lighten up, honey, huh?

443
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,360
能给我笑笑吗
Got a smile for me?

444
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,500
怪胎
Freak.

445
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,990
所有地球上的生命都是碳基的  但他不是
All life on Earth is carbon-based. Not this guy.

446
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,810
不管他是什么做的
Whatever he runs on,

447
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,310
反正周期表上没有
it's not on the periodic table.

448
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,970
你是说  他不是这里的
You're saying he's not from around here?

449
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,400
你的眼睛怎么样了
How's your eye?

450
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,120
眼睛倒没事
Well, I'd say fine...

451
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,850
就是不敢相信我看到的东西
but it can't believe what it's seeing.

452
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:33,800
你说这玩意之前是科尔森的样子
You say this thing looked like Coulson?

453
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,300
说话也像
Talked like him, too.

454
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,380
那女人说还有更多这种人
And the woman said that there were more?

455
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,680
她说的是"潜入"
The word she used was "infiltration."

456
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,780
你相信她吗
You believe her?

457
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,480
直到见到这个才信
Not till I saw this.

458
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,540
你有什么打算
What's your plan?

459
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,180
我能找到那个百视达姑娘
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

460
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,140
有桩摩托车盗窃的报案
I got word on a motorcycle thief

461
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,750
女贼符合她的描述
that fits her description.

462
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,660
如果她能说出这些蜥蜴人为什么来
If she can tell us why these lizards are here...

463
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,750
或许她也能告诉我们怎么赶走他们
maybe she can tell us how to kick 'em to the curb.

464
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,760
好
Good.

465
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,140
但你自己行动  我们谁都不能信任
Do it alone, though. We can't trust anyone.

466
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,400
连我们自己人都不行
Not even our own men.

467
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,890
是  长官
Yes, sir.

468
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,250
他们可真丑  是吧
They're ugly bastards, aren't they?

469
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,910
是啊  可不比布拉德·皮特  长官
Yeah, well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

470
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,360
安然超度吧  我的朋友
Safe journey to the beyond, my friend.

471
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,330
我会完成我们的大业
I will finish what we started.

472
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,430
最好别靠太近  老大
I wouldn't get too close there, boss.

473
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,320
任何人不得进出
No one in or out.

474
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,080
需要点什么
What can I get ya?

475
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,890
这张照片是哪拍的
Where was this photograph taken?

476
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,900
一个机场
An airport.

477
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,190
飞马计划在哪
Where's Pegasus?

478
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,060
那是机密
That's classified.

479
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,300
我给你建立的档案也是
Not unlike the file I started on you.

480
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,150
但看来你还换装了
But I see you've changed it up a bit since then.

481
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,730
垃圾摇滚挺衬你
Grunge is a good look for you.

482
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,450
你今天不顺吗  弗瑞特工
Did you have a rough day, Agent Fury?

483
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,190
还行吧
It was cool, you know?

484
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,070
遭遇了太空入侵  大型追车
Had a space invasion, big car chase.

485
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,310
还看了一场外星人尸检
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

486
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,460
也就典型的工作日
Typical nine-to-five.

487
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,650
你看到一个了
So you saw one?

488
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,490
我并不怎么信外星人
I was never one to believe in aliens...

489
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,490
但那画面我是忘不掉了
but I can't unsee that.

490
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,610
这会比较尴尬  但我必须问
This is gonna get a little awkward, but I gotta ask.

491
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,940
你觉得我也是那种绿玩意
You think I'm one of those green things.

492
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,270
小心驶得万年船
Can't be too careful.

493
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,360
我可是百分百的红血地球人
You are looking at 100% red-blooded Earth man.

494
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,830
我恐怕需要点证明
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

495
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,920
你是想验唾液还是验尿
We talking cheek swab or urine sample?

496
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,760
不  DNA也会一样的
No. The DNA would match.

497
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,000
那我的美国在线密码呢
Want my AOL password?

498
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,320
斯库鲁人只能模仿宿主的近期记忆
Skrulls can only sim recent memories of their host bodies.

499
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,070
你想聊私事

500
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,000

00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,100
-探探先生  -我就这么说的
- Mr. Snoofers? - That's what I said.

504
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,830
我通过了吗
Do I pass?

505
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,010
还没  第一份工作

506
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,960
士兵  高中毕业就参军了
Soldier. Straight out of high school.

507
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,410
退役时已做到了上校

508
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,560
-然后呢  -间谍

-在哪做  -那时是冷战

510
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,080
我们无所不在
We were everywhere.

511
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,570
贝尔法斯特  布加勒斯特
Belfast. Bucharest.

512
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,000
贝尔格莱德  布达佩斯
Belgrade. Budapest.

513
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,620
我喜欢B开头的  比较押韵
I like the B's. I can make them rhyme.

514
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,810
-现在呢  -干六年文职了
- Now? - Been riding a desk for the past six years...

515
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,160
想搞清楚我们未来的敌人会从哪来
trying to figure out where our future enemies are coming from.

516
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,030
真没想到
Never occurred to me

517
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,230
会是从天上来
they would be coming from above.

518
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,270
说出一个非常怪异
Name a detail so bizarre

519
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,040
斯库鲁人绝编造不出来的细节
a Skrull could never fabricate it.

520
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,760
如果一片吐司被对角切开  我就不能吃了
If toast is cut diagonally, I can't eat it.

521
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,250
你并不需要知道那个  是吧
You didn't need that, did you?

522
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,370
是啊  不  但我喜欢
No. No, I didn't. But I enjoyed it.

523
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,800
好吧  该你了
Okay. Your turn.

524
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,890
证明你不是斯库鲁人
Prove you're not a Skrull.

525
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,080
这怎么就能向我证明
And how is that supposed to prove to me

526
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,630
你不是斯库鲁人了
you're not a Skrull?

527
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,170
那是光子炮
That's a photon blast.

528
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,200
怎么
And?

529
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,610
斯库鲁人做不到的
A Skrull can't do that.

530
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,470
那么  上校
So, a full bird colonel

531
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,010
改做间谍  改做神盾局特工
turned spy turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

532
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,160
你的安全权限肯定挺高
must have pretty high security clearance.

533
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,280
飞马计划在哪
Where's Pegasus?

534
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,570
好吧  斯库鲁人能模仿外星种族
Okay. The Skrulls sim alien races

535
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,560
以潜入并夺取星球
to infiltrate and take over planets.

536
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,750
你是个克里人  你们是高尚的战士种族
And you're a Kree? A race of noble warriors?

537
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,210
英雄  高尚的战士英雄
Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.

538
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,940
那么  斯库鲁人找劳森博士做什么
So, um, what do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?

539
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,000
他们认为她在飞马计划
They believe that she developed

540
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,350
开发了一种光速引擎
a light-speed engine at Pegasus.

541
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,030
光速引擎
Light-speed engine?

542
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,640
得承认  这还不算我今天听到的最疯狂的事
Gotta admit, that's not the craziest thing I've heard today.

543
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,470
这还早嘛
Well, it's still early.

544
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,180
你呢  你想要什么
And you, what do you want?

545
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,370
及时阻止斯库鲁人
To stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable.

546
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,470
然后呢
And?

547
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,150
战争是一种通用语言
Look, war is a universal language.

548
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,180
我能辨认得出一个擅自行动的士兵
I know a rogue soldier when I see one.

549
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,710
你有私人的动机
You got a personal stake in this.

550
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,640
这里是政府地界
This is government property.

551
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,200
请调头
Turn your vehicle around.

552
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,280
尼古拉斯·约瑟夫·弗瑞  神盾局特工

562
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,410
如果我有了孩子  他们也会喊我弗瑞
If I have them, they'll call me Fury.

563
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,600
你们可以进入了

564
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,650
谢谢
Thank you.

565
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,720
等等
Hold up.

566
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,070
你看上去像谁的叛逆侄女
You look like somebody's disaffected niece.

567
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,560
戴上这个
Put that on.

568
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,610
-这是什么  -是神盾局的标志
- What is it? - It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. Logo.

569
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,150
在衣服上标注你的身份
Does, uh, announcing your identity on clothing

570
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,820
有助于你工作的秘密性吗
help with the covert part of your job?

571
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,550
穿橡胶衣的太空战士还好意思说我
Said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit.

572
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,820
把法兰绒衬衫脱了
Lose the flannel.

573
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,840
有什么事吗
How can I help you?

574
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,490
我们是神盾局特工
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

575
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,300
我们在找一个叫劳森的女人
We're looking for a woman named Lawson.

576
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,580
温迪·劳森博士
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

577
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,140
你认识她吗
Do you know her?

578
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,010
跟我来
Follow me.

579
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,550
你知道什么叫"迎宾队"吗
You familiar with the phrase "welcome wagon"?

580
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,050
不
No.

581
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,480
反正不是这样的
Well, this ain't it.

582
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,020
那是个通讯器吗
Is that a communicator?

583
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,170
是的  最先进的双向寻呼机
Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.

584
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,540
你在呼叫谁
Who are you paging?

585
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,900
我妈  别担心  我没提你
My mom. Don't worry. I didn't mention you.

586
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,110
你先请
After you.

587
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,350
厉害
Impressive.

588
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,430
你该看看我能用回形针施展什么魔法
You should see what I can do with a paperclip.

589
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,980
小家伙  你好吗
Hey, there. How are you?

590
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,480
天呐  看看你  看看你啊
Oh, my goodness. Look at you. Just look at you.

591
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,830
你是不是最可爱了
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

592
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:41,170
你多可爱  你叫什么
Aren't you cute? And what's your name, huh?

593
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,420
你叫什么
What's your name?

594
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,570
"咕咕"  酷猫酷名
"Goose." Cool name for a cool cat.

595
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:46,620
弗瑞
Fury?

596
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,100
我就回来
I'll be back.

597
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,630
等我把指纹拿出来
Let me get my fingerprint out.

598
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,690
把它打开就行
Just let me unravel this puppy.

599
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,940
你就坐在那里  看着我摆弄胶带
You sat there and watched me play with tape?

600
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,070
你只需要...
When all you had to do was...

601
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,820
我不想抢你的风头
I didn't wanna steal your thunder.

602
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,420
劳森
Lawson.

603
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,820
劳森的光速引擎图纸
Lawson's plan for the light-speed engine.

604
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,370
他们为什么中止了这个项目呢
I wonder why they terminated the project.

605
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,570
或许是因为她
Maybe because she's

606
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,370
疯了
cuckoo.

607
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,050
克里文字
Kree glyphs?

608
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,440
劳森不是疯子
Lawson is not cuckoo.

609
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,410
她是克里人
She's Kree.

610
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:03,090
反正她死了
Well, she's dead.

611
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:04,220
什么
What?

612
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,170
她在一次未授权试飞中
She crashed the Asis aircraft

613
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,350
撞毁了一架艾西斯战机
doing an unauthorized test flight.

614
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,140
还害死了个飞行员
Took a pilot down with her.

615
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,790
所以这里的保安才那么不友好
That's why security here is so unfriendly.

616
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,600
他们在掩盖一个价值十亿的过失
They're covering up a billion-dollar mistake.

617
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,070
你的光速引擎也烧毁了
And your light-speed engine is toast.

618
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,450
坠机什么时候发生的
When did this crash happen?

619
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,160
六年前  1989年
Six years ago. 1989.

620
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,660
飞行员是谁
Who was the pilot?

621
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,160
大部分文件都编辑过了
Most of this thing's redacted...

622
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,050
但这里有一份玛利亚·兰博的证词
but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau.

623
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,050
她是最后见到活着的她们的人
Last person to see them alive.

624
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,580
你没事吧
You okay?

625
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,500
马上回来
Back in a minute.

626
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,700
这不是为了作战
This isn't about fighting wars.

627
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,780
而是为了结束战争
It's about ending them.

628
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,170
我知道劳森是克里人
I know Lawson was Kree.

629
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,170
她就在C53星球上  而且死于坠机
She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash.

630
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,200
你对此知情吗
Do you know anything about this?

631
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:45,180
我刚发现了一份C53发来的任务报告
I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53.

632
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:49,050
我有权告诉你的不多  弗斯  但是
There's only so much I'm cleared to tell you, Vers, but...

633
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,960
劳森是一名卧底克里特工  名叫玛威尔
Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell.

634
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,470
她在研究一种独特的能量核
She was working on a unique energy core.

635
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,240
实验一种据说可以
Experimenting with tech that apparently

636
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,900
助我们赢下战争的科技
could help us win the war.

637
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,400
她还在吗
She still here?

638
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,740
她在配合调查  长官
She's cooperating with the investigation, sir.

639
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,080
-你们留下  -是  长官
- You men stay here. - Yes, sir.

640
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,750
我要单独审讯她
I want to question her alone.

641
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,740
干得漂亮  尼古拉斯
Excellent work, Nicholas.

642
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,280
上面提到我了吗
Does it say anything about me?

643
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,530
提到你  当然没有
Anything about you? No, of course not.

644
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,630
怎么会呢
Why would it?

645
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,810
我找到证据  表明我曾在这里生活
I found evidence that I had a life here.

646
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,490
在C53上吗
On C-53?

647
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,080
我去见至高智慧时  看到的就是玛威尔
Mar-Vell is who I see when I visit the Supreme Intelligence.

648
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,500
我认识她  我认识身为劳森的她
I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.

649
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,820
这更像是斯库鲁人的模仿  弗斯
This sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers.

650
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,800
不  不是  因为我记得  我来过这里
No, it's not. Because I remember. I was here.

651
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,670
停下  记住你的训练
Stop. Remember your training.

652
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,780
了解你的敌人  你也可能是你的敌人
Know your enemy. It could be you.

653
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,380
别被情绪影响了你的判断力
Do not let your emotions override your judgment.

654
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,540
她在地下六层
She's on sublevel six.

655
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,780
我在五层下
I'll get off on five...

656
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,110
走楼梯  以防她企图逃跑
and take the stairs in case she makes a run for it.

657
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,700
像我们在哈瓦那时那样  两面夹击
Do a pincer move like we did in Havana.

658
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,690
对
Right.

659
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,990
就像在哈瓦那时那样
Like we did in Havana.

660
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:24,660
我们快到跳跃点了
We're nearing the jump point.

661
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,730
别关信标  让我们能找到你
Leave your beacon on so I can find you.

662
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,800
我们会查清真相的  弗斯
We'll get to the bottom of this, Vers.

663
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,520
我们一起
Together.

664
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,600
好
Okay.

665
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,730
弗斯
Vers!

666
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,840
弗斯
Vers!

667
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,880
弗瑞在与目标串通
Fury's colluding with the target.

668
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,120
那他为什么要叫支援
Then why would he call us in?

669
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,590
我只知道他也要抓
All I know is we take him in, too.

670
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,710
不论死活
Dead or alive.

671
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,880
不论死活
Dead or alive?

672
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,160
上上
Go. Go, go!

673
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,500
是我说错了什么吗
Was it something I said?

674
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,480
其实  我并不需要这个也能看见
Now, you know, I don't really need these to see...

675
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:38,870
但这身打扮少不了它
but they do kinda complete the look.

676
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,050
是不是
Don't you think?

677
00:52:58,690 --> 00:52:59,580
你叫他们来的
You called them in?

678
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,860
我不好
My bad.

679
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,230
科尔森  你发现他们了吗
Coulson, do you have eyes on them?

680
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,390
他们不在下面
They're not down here.

681
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,780
我们上楼吧
Let's try up there.

682
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,000
-什么  -你的通讯器
- What? - Your communicator.

683
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,860
在你手里显然不安全
You obviously can't be trusted with it.

684
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,360
你会飞这玩意吗
Do you know how to fly this thing?

685
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,650
试试便知
We'll see.

686
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,890
回答会不会就行了
That's a yes or no question.

687
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,760
会
Yes.

688
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,700
这就对了
That's what I'm talking about!

689
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,390
我们有个偷渡者
We got a stowaway.

690
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,390
撑住  咕咕
Hang on, Goose.

691
00:54:58,890 --> 00:54:59,880
咕咕
Goose.

692
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,900
不  咕咕
No, Goose.

693
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,940
谁是只乖喵喵
Who's a good kitty, huh?

694
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,100
咕咕
Goose?

695
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,700
没错
Yes, that's right.

696
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,770
谁是只乖喵喵  咕咕
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

697
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:13,860
你是只乖喵喵
You the good kitty, that's right.

698
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,500
看到认识的人了吗
See anyone you know?

699
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,100
说来好笑
Funny story.

700
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:22,130
我奄奄一息地被送到哈拉  失去了记忆
I arrived on Hala near dead. No memory.

701
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,410
那是六年前的事
That was six years ago.

702
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:26,430
所以你觉得你是那个
So, you think you're the pilot

703
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,930
跟劳森博士一起坠机的飞行员
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

704
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,780
我是说  最后见到活着的她们的人
I'm saying the last person to see them alive

705
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,300
或许能告诉我们
could probably tell us.

706
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,780
玛利亚·兰博
Maria Rambeau?

707
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,290
我们怎么去路易斯安那州
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

708
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,600
往东飞  在孟菲斯右转
Due east. Hang a right at Memphis.

709
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,190
那个特工
That agent...

710
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,150
阻止了斯库鲁人找到我们的那个
that stopped the Skrulls from finding us?

711
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:45,700
科尔森  新来的
Coulson. The new guy.

712
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,850
看来他还不恨我
I guess he doesn't hate me yet.

713
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,590
是啊  给他时间吧
Yeah, well, give him time.

714
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,310
看来他是有种感觉
I guess he had a feeling, you know?

715
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,310
于是听从了直觉  而违抗命令
Went with his gut against orders.

716
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,140
这是很难做到的
That's a really hard thing to do.

717
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,280
但也是我们的人性
But it's what keeps us human.

718
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,650
我经常为此惹麻烦呢
I get in trouble for that. A lot.

719
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,440
这我看出来了
I can see that about you.

720
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,630
营救把你出卖给斯库鲁人的家伙
Rescuing the guy who sold you out to the Skrulls?

721
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:11,360
那不是标准的克里人行动规章吧
I'm guessing that's not standard Kree operating procedure.

722
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,690
如果你不向我上级打小报告  那我也不说
Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine.

723
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,880
罗南
Ronan.

724
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,930
指控者已完成了行动
The Accusers completed their operation...

725
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,510
但因为你们小队  更重要的任务失败了
but the greater mission was a failure, thanks to your team.

726
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,940
那是个陷阱
It was a trap

727
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,130
是为引诱我们的特工弗斯到托法  好绑架她
to lure our operative Vers to Torfa and kidnap her.

728
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:33,210
告诉我们地点
Give us their location.

729
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,960
我们会解决恐怖分子威胁
We'll take care of the terrorist threat.

730
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,840
你要把他们炸出银河系吗
By bombing them out of the galaxy?

731
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,280
不  我们来解决
No, we'll handle this.

732
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,160
不论在哪  一小撮斯库鲁人
A cell of Skrulls anywhere

733
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,450
对所有克里人都是威胁
is a threat to Kree everywhere.

734
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:45,580
他们在哪
Where are they?

735
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,960
-他们...  -不见了
- They are... - Lost.

736
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,690
暂时下落不明
They are lost for now.

737
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,590
但我们会找到他们的
But we will find them.

738
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,820
那去吧
Do so,

739
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:56,530
否则我们就接手
or we will.

740
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,630
继续航向C53
Maintain the course for C-53.

741
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,060
打扰  我找玛利亚·兰博
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

742
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,800
卡罗尔阿姨
Auntie Carol?

743
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,010
妈妈  是卡罗尔阿姨
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

744
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:33,550
我就知道  大家都说你死了
I knew it! Everyone said you were dead!

745
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,460
但我们知道他们说谎了
But we knew they were lying.

746
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:40,040
我不是你以为的那个人
I'm not really who you think I am.

747
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,300
这是我听过的最疯狂的故事了
That is the craziest shit I ever heard.

748
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,410
会变形的绿外星人  没有这种事
Green transforming aliens? There's no such thing.

749
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,050
你说得太对了  小姑娘
You are absolutely right, young lady.

750
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,690
是没有这种事
There is no such thing.

751
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:59,100
因为即便有
'Cause if there were,

752
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,790
我们也不会想说出去
we would want to keep that to ourselves.

753
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:03,050
你不信吗
You don't believe me?

754
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,540
不会吧
No way!

755
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,170
好酷啊
That's so cool!

756
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,420
她的手可不止能泡茶呢
She can do a lot more than make tea with those hands.

757
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,940
比如呢  露两手
Like what? Show us.

758
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,510
待会儿的吧
Maybe later.

759
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:22,540
你的东西我都还留着呢
I kept all your stuff.

760
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,680
我去拿
I'll go get it.

761
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:26,560
你要去帮帮她吗
You want to give her a hand with that?

762
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,670
你什么都不记得了
You don't remember anything?

763
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,680
我会看到些片段
I see flashes.

764
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,180
一些时刻
Little moments.

765
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,730
但我不知道那是不是真的
But I can't tell what's real.

766
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,800
如果我可以把那天早上发生的事拼凑起来
If I could just piece together what happened that morning...

767
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,960
或许就都能说得通了
maybe it'll all make sense.

768
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,620
你破晓时猛敲我的门  把我吵醒了
You woke me up banging on my door at dawn.

769
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,090
你总这样
Your usual move.

770
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,360
当时  我们必须起得很早
Back then, we had to get up so early.

771
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,480
空军还是不许女性飞战斗任务
The Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat...

772
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,950
所以  为劳森测试飞机是我们
so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot

773
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,440
唯一能做点要紧事的机会
at doing something that mattered.

774
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,440
你想开你的老野马飙车去基地
You wanted to race to base in your old Mustang...

775
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,500
我并不想跟你争
and I wasn't about to argue,

776
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,370
因为我知道我的科迈罗稳赢不输
'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate.

777
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,720
但你作弊了  走了捷径
But you cheated, took a shortcut.

778
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,990
捷径怎么就算作弊了
Since when is a shortcut cheating?

779
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:33,470
因为那有违预定的交战规则
Since it violates the predetermined rules of engagement.

780
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,320
这我可绝对不记得
I definitely don't remember those.

781
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:36,790
当然了
Of course you don't.

782
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:46,790
我到机库时  劳森很焦躁
When I got to the hangar, Lawson was agitated.

783
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,020
她说她还要拯救生命
She said she had lives to save.

784
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:52,830
她想自己开艾西斯
She was trying to take the Asis up herself,

785
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,980
但你说...
but you said that...

786
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:57,570
如果事关人命  那我要来开
If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.

787
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:58,620
对
Yeah.

788
00:59:58,970 --> 00:59:59,940
对
Yep.

789
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,800
重大的英雄时刻
Big hero moment.

790
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,730
那种我们都一直在等待的时刻
The kind of moment we'd both been waiting for.

791
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,950
博士一向很特别
The doc was always unique.

792
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,940
所以我们喜欢她
That's why we liked her.

793
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,690
但现在你说她是另一个星球来的
But now you're saying she's from another planet.

794
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,850
我知道你肯定很难接受
I know this must be hard for you.

795
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,530
怎么  这部分吗
Oh, what? This part right here?

796
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,060
不  不
No. No.

797
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,980
难的部分是失去我最好的朋友
What's hard is losing my best friend...

798
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:31,620
但这任务太机密
in a mission so secret

799
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,880
他们就假装什么都没发生
they act like it never even happened.

800
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:39,480
难的部分是知道你一直都活在某处
Hard is knowing you were out there somewhere

801
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,350
固执地不肯死去
too damn stubborn to die.

802
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,830
现在时隔六年  你又跑来
And now you come up in here after six years...

803
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,900
双手能发射高能
with your supercharged fire hands...

804
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,490
还要我喊你
and you expect me to call you...

805
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,600
什么...弗斯吗
I don't even know what. Vers?

806
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,220
你现在真是这个人了吗
Is that really who you are now?

807
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,760
我不知道
I don't know.

808
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,550
来看看
Come look!

809
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,430
这是我们在万圣节时
This is me and you on Halloween.

810
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,080
我是阿梅莉亚·埃尔哈特
I'm Amelia Earhart

811
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,600
你是詹尼斯·乔普林
and you're Janis Joplin.

812
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,350
这是你小时候
This is you when you were little.

813
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,200
你跟你父母关系不好
You didn't get along with your parents...

814
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
所以妈妈说  我们成了你真正的家人
so Mom said we became your real family.

815
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,000
这是我们圣诞节的时候
This is us on Christmas.

816
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,380
我收到了我最喜欢的兔子拖鞋
I got my favorite bunny slippers.

817
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,820
这也是张你小时候的照片
This is another picture of you when you were little.

818
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,800
你一直想当飞行员
You've always wanted to be a pilot.

819
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,890
这是你刚毕业时
And this is right after you graduated.

820
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,690
这是你圣诞节时收到的狗狗
This was your dog that you got for Christmas...

821
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,290
这是你空军小队的大合照
This is a picture of everybody from your Air Force team.

822
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,380
这是你和妈妈在一天训练顺利完成后照的
And this is you with Mom right after a good day of training.

823
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:37,640
他们是三个你最喜欢的人
These were your three favorite guys.

824
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:40,960
等等  我忘了
Wait. I forgot.

825
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,310
你的外套
Your jacket.

826
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,140
我在上面洒了番茄酱
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore

827
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,140
妈妈就不许我穿了
after I spilled ketchup on it.

828
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,160
那是坠机时唯一留下的
That was all that survived the crash.

829
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,310
至少我们以为是
Or so we thought.

830
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,250
别去开门
Don't answer that.

831
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,560
只是我的邻居
It's just my neighbor.

832
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,540
他们能变形成任何人
They can change into anyone.

833
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:20,950
你好
Hi there.

834
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:22,720
有什么事
What do you want?

835
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:25,350
汤姆
Tom.

836
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,190
这是我朋友  卡罗尔
This is my friend, Carol.

837
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:28,860
认识你很高兴
Pleased to meet you.

838
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:31,630
老天爷
Yowzers.

839
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,410
这里的静电可真要命
Static electricity out here's no joke.

840
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,470
我注意到你停在路边的那架大鸟
I noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road...

841
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,560
我只是想问
and I was just wondering...

842
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,340
我能不能带孩子们过来
if you mind if I bring the boys over

843
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,640
仔细看看
to get a closer look-see?

844
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,840
-仔细看看  -是啊
- A closer look-see? - Yeah.

845
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,840
看停在路边的大鸟
To see the "bird" parked out by the road?

846
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,270
你装得还真像啊  是吧
You're really working overtime to sell this one, aren't you,

847
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,730
塔罗斯
Talos?

848
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,750
抱歉  汤姆  现在真的不太方便
I'm sorry, Tom. This really isn't a good time.

849
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,860
我明天再去找你  好吗
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

850
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,950
好了
Okay.

851
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:05,000
你该对邻居更客气点的
You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors.

852
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:08,570
说不定哪天还要去借糖呢
You never know when you're gonna need to borrow some sugar.

853
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,030
等一下
Now, hang on a second.

854
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:17,630
先别急着挥你的魔术手
Before you go swinging those jazz hands around...

855
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,630
把你朋友家砸得稀巴烂
making a mess of your friend's house...

856
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,480
而且你家很漂亮  女士
It's a lovely home, miss.

857
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,850
天呐
Oh, my God!

858
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,920
怎么回事
What the hell?

859
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,430
没人会伤害她的
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

860
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,950
别杀我
Just don't kill me.

861
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,390
那样情况就真的麻烦了
That would really complicate the situation.

862
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,940
我再过五秒就要麻烦一墙的
I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall

863
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,680
恶心斯库鲁脑浆了
with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

864
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,230
抱歉我模仿了你的上司
I'm sorry I simmed your boss.

865
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:45,620
但现在  我以真身站在你们面前
But now I stand before you as my true self.

866
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,100
没有欺骗
Without deception.

867
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,590
那外面的是谁
And who is that out there?

868
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,570
好吧  有道理
Okay, that's a fair point...

869
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,540
但我相信你能理解
but I'm sure that you understand

870
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,740
我必须采取些预防措施
I had to take some precautions.

871
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:59,240
我看到你碾压了我20个最好的手下
I saw you crush 20 of my best men

872
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,670
而且你的手还被困着
with your hands bound.

873
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,710
我只想谈谈
I just wanna talk.

874
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,590
上次我们谈时
Last time we talked,

875
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,200
我被倒吊了起来
I ended up hanging from my ankles.

876
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,660
那时我还不知道你的身份
That was before I knew who you were.

877
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,880
我还不知道你跟其他人的不同之处
Before I knew what made you different from the others.

878
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,560
我有段飞马计划的录音
I have an audio recording from Pegasus...

879
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,230
录的是六年前一场坠机中
of your voice from a plane crash

880
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:18,010
你的声音
six years ago...

881
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:22,320
那个设备好像被你们称为"黑匣子"
on a device I believe you call a "black box."

882
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,090
他们说黑匣子毁于了坠机
They told me it was destroyed in the crash.

883
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,600
你怎么拿到的
How'd you get it?

884
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,720
她不懂
She don't understand.

885
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,540
小姑娘  我有独特的技能  让我可以
Young lady, I have a special skill that kind of allows me to

886
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,900
进入我不该进的地方
get into places I'm not supposed to be.

887
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,200
你再敢喊我"小姑娘"
Call me "young lady" again...

888
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,790
我就一脚踢到我不该踢到的地方
I'm gonna put my foot in a place it's not supposed to be.

889
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,500
难道要我猜那是哪里吗
Am I supposed to guess where that is?

890
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,140
你的屁股
Your ass.

891
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,940
好吧  我懂  我们都有点紧张
Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here.

892
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,630
但听着  我只需要你帮我
But, look, I just need your help

893
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,340
解码一个坐标
decoding some coordinates.

894
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,390
如果你坐下  听听录音
If you'll sit down and you'll listen to this...

895
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,520
我保证  你不会失望的
I assure you, it'll be worth your while.

896
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,360
把你的朋友叫进来  我就听
Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.

897
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,280
好
Deal.

898
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:03,850
天呐  把那玩意拿远点
Oh, my God! Get that thing away.

899
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,440
它怎么进来的
How'd that get in here?

900
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:09,110
猫吗
The cat?

901
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,970
你不会怕这个吧
This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?

902
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:12,380
那不是猫
That's not a cat.

903
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:15,330
-那是噬元兽  -噬元兽
- That's a Flerken. - A Flerken?

904
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:17,190
妈妈
Mom?

905
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:25,380
莫妮卡
Monica.

906
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,940
我为什么不能听
Why can't I listen, too?

907
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:55,980
怎么回事
What's happening?

908
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,430
在加载
It's loading.

909
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,140
输入坐标
Punch in the coordinates

910
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:07,680
5-2-2-9, negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.

911
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,040
收到  我们去哪  博士
Copy that. Where are we going, Doc?

912
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,390
我的实验室
My laboratory.

913
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,620
你的实验室  什么意思
Your laboratory? What do you mean?

914
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,010
不
Oh, no.

915
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:17,220
那是  等等  那是什么
Is that... Wait, what is that?

916
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,850
我的雷达上没有显示
It's not showing up on my radar.

917
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,500
快走  卡罗尔  快飞
Go, Carol. Fly!

918
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:23,250
那可不是米格  劳森  他们是什么人
That's no MiG, Lawson. Who the hell are they?

919
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,630
那是坏人  飞快点
Those are the bad guys. Fly faster now!

920
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:26,690
是  长官
Yes, ma'am.

921
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:34,930
-他们想要什么  -我  我的研究
- What do they want? - Me. My work.

922
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,540
我就不该带你来
I never should have brought you along.

923
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,020
要难受了
Here come some G's.

924
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:03,680
他们在向后开火  撑住
They're firing backwards. Hold on!

925
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:16,540
跳伞  跳伞
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

926
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,860
撑住  劳森
Stay with me, Lawson!

927
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,390
卡罗尔  回复  你收到吗
Carol, come in. Do you copy?

928
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,890
我收到  我们坠机了
Yeah, I copy. We hit ground.

929
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:45,550
卡罗尔  你没事吧  你收到吗
Carol, are you okay? Do you copy?

930
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,230
我收到
Yeah! I copy.

931
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:51,370
博士
Doc?

932
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,560
你的血
Your blood.

933
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,290
是蓝的
It's blue.

934
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,740
是啊  但我的发型没事吧
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

935
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,000
帮帮我  好吗
Help me out, will ya?

936
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,970
我得在他们赶到前毁掉它
I gotta destroy it before they get here.

937
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,980
劳森
Lawson?

938
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,500
记得我怎么说我们的工作的吗
You remember what I said about our work here?

939
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,010
目的是什么
What it's for?

940
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:17,530
结束战争
To end wars?

941
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,740
对  但战争的规模比你想的要大
Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know.

942
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:23,320
该死
Damn it!

943
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,690
我不叫劳森
My name is not Lawson.

944
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,270
我的真名是玛威尔
My real name is Mar-Vell,

945
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,500
我来自哈拉星球
and I come from a planet called Hala.

946
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,180
我想说你是脑袋糊涂了
I would say that you're delusional... but

947
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,730
但我们刚被太空飞船打下来
we just got shot down by a spaceship

948
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:39,410
你的血又是蓝的
and your blood is blue.

949
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:44,050
听着  我半辈子都在打一场可耻的战争
Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war.

950
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:47,400
你快走吧  别让我更加懊悔了
Now, skedaddle before you give me any more regrets.

951
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,780
记住那坐标  好吗
Just remember the coordinates, okay?

952
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:52,130
你得单独救他们了
You gotta save 'em without me.

953
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,360
救谁  怎么救
Save who? How?

954
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,600
我得在他们找到前炸毁引擎
Now I gotta blow this engine before they find it.

955
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,760
你干什么
What are you doing?

956
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,040
我们无意伤害你
We have no interest in hurting you.

957
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,080
是吗
No?

958
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,290
因为你们猛烈的火力让我不那么觉得
'Cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!

959
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:27,230
能量核
The energy core.

960
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,170
在哪
Where is it?

961
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,050
伞兵救援很快就到
Pararescue's on the way.

962
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:34,380
还有两分钟  你就会被包围
You have two minutes until you're surrounded.

963
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,850
那就没必要继续跟你废话了
Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.

964
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:37,880
不  等等
No, wait!

965
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,060
你是问那个能量核吗
You mean that energy core?

966
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,620
不
No!

967
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:38,840
指挥官  她还在动  可以开火吗
Commander? She's still moving. Permission to fire.

968
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,030
别开火
Hold your fire.

969
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,060
什么都不剩了
There's nothing left.

970
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,390
核被摧毁了
The core has been destroyed.

971
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:04,880
她吸收了核的能量
She absorbed its power.

972
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,720
她要跟我们走
She's coming with us.

973
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,120
他骗了我
He lied to me.

974
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:35,970
我所知的一切都是谎言
Everything that I knew was a lie.

975
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,740
现在你明白了
Now, you understand.

976
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:41,340
什么  我明白什么了
What? What do I understand now?

977
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,370
勇·罗格杀了玛威尔
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

978
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,540
他杀了她
He killed her...

979
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:46,510
因为她发现
'cause she found out that

980
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:50,920
自己站在战争中不正义的一方
she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.

981
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,950
不
No.

982
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:54,430
斯库鲁人都是恐怖分子
Your people are terrorists.

983
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,060
他们杀无辜者
They kill innocents.

984
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,730
我看到托法上的废墟了
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

985
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,890
那是指控者干的
Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for.

986
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:05,630
我们是作为难民在托法上生活
My people lived as refugees on Torfa.

987
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:08,860
无家可归  就因为我们反对克里统治
Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule...

988
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:11,100
被他们摧毁了家园
and they destroyed our planet.

989
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:13,640
我们仅剩的不多的人
And the handful of us that are left

990
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,920
也会遭到屠戮
will be slaughtered next...

991
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,880
除非你帮我完成玛威尔的目标
unless you help me finish what Mar-Vell started.

992
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:23,570
她发现的核
The core that she found

993
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,310
能驱动光速飞船
would have powered a light-speed ship...

994
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,320
可以带我们前往安全之处
capable of carrying us to safety.

995
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:31,380
前往克里人找不到的新家园
A new home where the Kree can't reach us.

996
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:35,230
劳森总说我们飞马计划的工作
Lawson always told us that our work at Pegasus

997
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,830
不是为了作战
wasn't to fight wars...

998
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,140
是为了结束战争
but to end them.

999
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:43,590
她希望你帮我们找到能量核
She wanted you to help us find the core.

1000
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,150
我已经摧毁了它
Well, I already destroyed it.

1001
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:47,860
不  你毁掉了引擎
No, you destroyed the engine.

1002
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:50,760
但驱动它的能量核在其他地方
The core that powered it is in a remote location.

1003
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:54,570
如果你能帮我们解码坐标
If you help us decode those coordinates...

1004
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,820
我们就能找到它
we can find it.

1005
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,850
你会用它对付我们的
You'll use it to destroy us.

1006
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:05,610
我们只想要个家
We just want a home.

1007
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:15,220
你和我都因克里人失去了一切
You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree.

1008
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:17,080
你还不明白吗
Can't you see it now?

1009
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:19,140
你不是他们的人
You're not one of them.

1010
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,140
你不了解我
You don't know me.

1011
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:27,130
你不知道我是谁
You have no idea who I am.

1012
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,290
我都不知道我是谁
I don't even know who I am!

1013
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:35,040
你是卡罗尔·丹弗斯
You are Carol Danvers.

1014
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,100
你是那个黑匣子上录下的女人
You are the woman on that black box

1015
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,070
为了做正确的事不惜冒生命危险
risking her life to do the right thing.

1016
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,390
我最好的朋友
My best friend...

1017
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,680
在我没有其他人时  支持我这个单亲妈妈
who supported me as a mother and a pilot

1018
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,220
和飞行员
when no one else did.

1019
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:54,230
你聪明  幽默  非常烦人
You are smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass...

1020
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,140
你是我认识的最强大的人
and you were the most powerful person I knew...

1021
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,120
哪怕是你还不会用手开火的时候
way before you could shoot fire from your fists.

1022
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,470
你听到了吗
You hear me?

1023
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,530
你听到了吗
Do you hear me?

1024
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:16,240
过来  过来  姑娘
Come here. Come here, girl.

1025
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,240
有我呢
I got you.

1026
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,310
我知道我不配让你信任我
I know I don't deserve your trust...

1027
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:28,050
但你是我们唯一的线索
but you were our only lead.

1028
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:30,670
我们发现你的能量信号
We discovered that your energy signature

1029
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:33,080
与玛威尔的能量核一致
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1030
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,580
现在我们知道原因了
Now we know why.

1031
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:41,950
如果你知道它对我是多么重要
If only you knew the importance of it to me.

1032
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,520
我就需要你帮我
I just need your help

1033
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,360
破解玛威尔实验室的坐标
decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.

1034
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:52,170
那不是坐标  是状态向量
Those weren't coordinates. They're state vectors.

1035
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:54,130
环绕位置和速度的
For orbital position and velocity.

1036
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,850
你在地球上找不到她的实验室
You didn't find her lab on Earth,

1037
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:57,280
因为它不在地球上
'cause it's not on Earth.

1038
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:59,860
那是六年前坠机日时的地点
That was the location on the date of the crash six years ago.

1039
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,020
只要追踪其轨迹
If we track its course,

1040
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,670
马上就能在环绕轨道上找到它
we'll find it in orbit right now.

1041
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,360
只是基本物理
It's just basic physics.

1042
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,310
轨道环绕
In orbit?

1043
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,700
就那么难破解吗
Was that so difficult to figure out?

1044
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,010
你可是我的科技人员
I mean, you're my science guy, right?

1045
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:17,560
勇·罗格很快就会找到我
Yon-Rogg will catch up to me soon.

1046
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,630
我们得在他之前找到能量核
We've got to get to the core before he does.

1047
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,060
我们上太空吗
We're going to space?

1048
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:23,730
乘什么去
In what?

1049
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,840
稍稍调整下你的飞机应该就行
A few tweaks to your vessel should do it.

1050
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,140
我可以负责改装
I can handle the modifications.

1051
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:29,540
你的科技人员
Your science guy.

1052
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,340
我需要个副驾
Well, I could use a copilot.

1053
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:42,400
不  我不能
No. No, I can't.

1054
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,670
我不能丢下莫妮卡
I can't leave Monica.

1055
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,240
妈妈  没事  我可以去外婆外公家住
Mom, it's okay. I can stay with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1056
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:49,750
我不能去  宝贝  太危险了
There's no way I'm going, baby. It's too dangerous.

1057
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,860
测试新航空科技还危险呢
Testing brand-new aerospace tech is dangerous...

1058
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,320
你以前不也做那个吗
and you used to do that.

1059
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,480
你的计划是乘坐一架
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere

1060
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,390
原本不能离开大气的飞机离开大气
in a craft not designed for the journey...

1061
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:00,030
而且还可能遭遇
and you anticipate hostile encounters

1062
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:02,600
科技更先进的外星敌人
with a technologically-superior foreign enemy.

1063
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,640
是吗
Correct?

1064
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,160
所以我说啊
That's what I'm saying.

1065
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,320
-你必须去  -莫妮卡
- You have to go! - Monica!

1066
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,790
你有机会去执行任务史上
You have a chance to fly the coolest mission

1067
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:09,110
最酷的任务
in the history of missions...

1068
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,710
你要放弃这机会  坐在沙发上
and you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch

1069
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:12,480
跟我一起看《新鲜王子》吗
and watch Fresh Prince with me?

1070
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,650
什么
What?

1071
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,220
我觉得你该好好想想
I just think you should consider

1072
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:18,000
你在给你的女儿立下什么样的榜样
what kind of example you're setting for your daughter.

1073
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,360
这是怎么回事
What's going on around here?

1074
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,070
我知道
I know, I know.

1075
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,720
我去里面解释  谢谢你们
I'll explain inside. Thank you.

1076
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,950
你妈妈很幸运
Your mom's lucky.

1077
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,780
天上发孩子时
When they were handing out kids,

1078
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:40,590
给了她最坚强的一个
they gave her the toughest one.

1079
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:42,700
捣蛋中尉
Lieutenant Trouble.

1080
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,720
你记得了
You remembered.

1081
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,360
那是我的吗
Is that mine?

1082
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:49,620
不
No, no.

1083
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,650
你留着吧  等我回来再说
You hang on to it until I come back.

1084
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,220
但有件事我需要你帮忙
But there is something that I need your help with.

1085
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,530
我不能再穿克里人的颜色了
I can't wear these Kree colors anymore.

1086
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,920
而因为你显然是这里唯一
And since you are obviously the only person around here

1087
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,540
有时尚感的人
with any sense of style...

1088
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,270
不行
No.

1089
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,810
绝对不行
Definitely not.

1090
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,860
既然我们是一队的
Well, since we're on the same team...

1091
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,060
我看上去如何
How do I look?

1092
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:44,930
靓丽
Fresh.

1093
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:06,330
你怎么才来
What took you so long?

1094
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:09,460
我很好  多谢关心
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1095
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:12,280
-PRY46B  -不  不说密码了
- PRY46-B... - No, no codes.

1096
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,430
这系统不可靠了  我们都知道了
That system is fallible, as we've learned.

1097
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,970
好吧  那我们开始吧
Okay, then let's do this.

1098
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:20,960
我与至高智慧密谈时  看到的是谁
Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?

1099
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,970
你最崇拜尊敬的人吧
The person you most admire and respect, I'd guess.

1100
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:25,610
但你绝不会告诉我是谁的
But you would never tell me who.

1101
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,840
你对哈拉最早的记忆是什么
And what is your earliest memory of Hala?

1102
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,110
输血
The transfusion.

1103
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,480
蓝血流过我的血管
Blue blood running through my veins.

1104
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,990
谁的血
Whose blood?

1105
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,690
流过她血管的是我的血
That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.

1106
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,170
你把她怎么了
What have you done with her?

1107
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:57,410
你太迟了
You're too late.

1108
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:15,990
她知道了
She knows?

1109
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,010
罗南  斯库鲁人已潜入了C53
Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53.

1110
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:34,960
马上来
Come at once.

1111
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,220
为了全体克里人  指挥官
For the good of all Kree, Commander,

1112
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,870
入侵者会被根除的
the infestation will be eradicated.

1113
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,510
高度500  还在攀升
Passing 500 and climbing.

1114
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,690
你真的不该把那玩意放腿上
You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.

1115
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:54,210
我们跟你的联盟没那么可靠
Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best.

1116
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:57,100
只要它还能吓到你
And as long as he continues to freak you out...

1117
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,290
就像这样
like that...

1118
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,290
嗯  我就要继续
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him

1119
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:03,820
爱它抱它  让它满意
all the loves and hugs that he needs, right?

1120
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:05,470
我能问你件事吗
Can I ask you something?

1121
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,520
你可以想变成什么变成什么
Do you just turn into anything you want?

1122
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:09,380
我得先看到
Well, I have to see it first.

1123
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:10,900
你们都能吗
Can you all do it?

1124
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:12,820
从生理学上讲  是的
Physiologically? Yeah.

1125
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,080
但这是需要练习的
But, uh, it takes practice...

1126
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,180
不瞒你说  还需要天赋  才能做好
and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well.

1127
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,660
-你能变成猫吗  -猫是什么
- Can you turn into a cat? - What's a cat?

1128
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:23,320
那文件柜呢
What about a filing cabinet?

1129
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,710
我为什么要变成文件柜
Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?

1130
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:27,610
捕蝇草呢
A Venus flytrap?

1131
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:28,830
如果你能变成捕蝇草
I'll give you 50 bucks right now

1132
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:30,550
我这就给你50块
if you turn into a Venus flytrap.

1133
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,520
超音速燃烧冲压式喷气引擎切换至核聚变引擎
Switching engines from Scramjet to Fusion.

1134
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,960
坐稳了  各位
Buckle up, folks.

1135
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:47,550
这正常吗  是太空紊流吗
Is this normal, like, space turbulence?

1136
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:48,690
差不多吧
Pretty much.

1137
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,100
锁定坐标网格
Locking in on coordinate grid.

1138
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:26,180
它在哪呢
Where is it?

1139
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,790
就在这里  肯定在这里
It's here. It's gotta be here.

1140
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:37,620
那是在空空荡荡前面还是后面
Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?

1141
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,140
去隐形启动
Decloaking activated.

1142
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,030
就是那个吗  能量核
Is that it? The core?

1143
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,240
在她的笔记里  她称之为宇宙魔方
In her notes she called it the Tesseract.

1144
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:03,720
劳森怎么会有这么多孩子玩具
What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?

1145
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,320
这里有别人
We're not alone.

1146
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:42,310
塔罗斯
Talos!

1147
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,980
他不是来找宇宙魔方的
He didn't come here for the Tesseract.

1148
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,180
没事
It's okay.

1149
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,000
我们不知道该怎么办
We didn't know what to do.

1150
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:29,070
玛威尔警告我们无论如何都不能发信号
Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason...

1151
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,220
否则会被克里人找到
or the Kree would find us.

1152
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:32,790
你做得对
You did the right thing.

1153
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:44,350
没事
It's okay, it's okay.

1154
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,960
她没事  她是个朋友
She's all right. She's a friend.

1155
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:50,620
我不会伤害你们的
I am not gonna hurt you.

1156
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,400
是她让我找到你们的
She led me to you.

1157
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,830
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1158
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:58,010
我之前不知道
I didn't know.

1159
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,320
卡罗尔
Carol.

1160
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,660
这是战争
This is war.

1161
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:05,260
我手上也沾满了鲜血
My hands are filthy from it, too.

1162
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,350
但我们走到了这一步
But we're here now.

1163
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,140
你找到了我的家人
You found my family.

1164
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,090
这只是个开始
This is just the beginning.

1165
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:20,330
我们还有数千人  散落在银河系各处
There are thousands of us separated from each other...

1166
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,820
彼此分离
scattered throughout the galaxy.

1167
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:44,160
如果我同一台弹球机玩六年
If I played the same pinball machine for six years...

1168
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,960
也能打出很高的分
I'd have some high scores, too.

1169
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,890
亲近敌人
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1170
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:06,540
你把你的制服怎么了
What did you do to your uniform?

1171
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:08,730
他们控制了她的心智  就像我们猜的那样
They got in her head. Just like we thought.

1172
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:10,370
至高智慧能恢复她的心智
The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.

1173
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:12,310
你看得到他们不是战士
You can see they're not soldiers.

1174
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:14,340
放了他们吧  把我抓走
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1175
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:15,570
能量核呢
And the core?

1176
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,700
你骗了我
You lied to me.

1177
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:21,370
我让你成了最好的自己
I made you the best version of yourself.

1178
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,120
赐予你的也能收回
What's given can be taken away.

1179
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,650
过去  快走
Back here! Move, move!

1180
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,690
过去  趴下
Get over here. Get down!

1181
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:48,110
快走  走
Let's go! Go, move!

1182
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,640
她来了
There she is.

1183
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,940
看来你在C53上的经历让你想起了曾经
Seems like your time on C-53 jogged the old memory.

1184
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:35,370
这件外套
This jacket.

1185
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,020
真是帅爆了
It's killer, by the way.

1186
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:43,070
音乐  真不错
The music. It's a nice touch.

1187
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:45,040
放我走
Let me out.

1188
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,380
不行
No can do.

1189
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,460
如果你伤害他们  我就把你烧毁
If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground.

1190
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,110
用什么呢
With what exactly?

1191
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:53,990
你的能力来自我们
Your power comes from us.

1192
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:56,310
这能力不是你们给的
You didn't give me these powers.

1193
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:57,170
是那场爆炸
The blast did.

1194
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:58,610
但你一直都不够强大
And yet, you've never had the strength

1195
01:27:58,610 --> 01:28:00,200
不能自己控制好
to control them on your own.

1196
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,690
物种  噬元兽
Species: Flerken.

1197
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,070
威胁程度  高
Threat: high.

1198
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,460
它是只猫  不是汉尼拔·莱克特
It's a cat, not Hannibal Lecter.

1199
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,140
物种  人类男性
Species: human male.

1200
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,200
威胁程度  几乎为零
Threat: low to none.

1201
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:31,910
那玩意显然是坏了
That thing's clearly busted.

1202
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:33,610
把噬元兽装上氦核飞船
Load the Flerken onto the Helion.

1203
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,450
把其他的丢进太空
Eject the others into space.

1204
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:41,470
你做得很棒  王牌
You did good, Ace.

1205
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:44,040
因为你
Thanks to you...

1206
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,220
那些险恶的变形人
those insidious shapeshifters

1207
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,270
再不能威胁我们的边境了
will threaten our borders no more.

1208
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:50,240
我以前相信过你的谎言
I used to believe your lies...

1209
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:52,730
但斯库鲁人只是在为建立家园而战
but the Skrulls are just fighting for a home.

1210
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:54,840
你想摧毁他们
You're talking about destroying them

1211
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,890
就因为他们不肯屈从你的规矩
because they won't submit to your rule.

1212
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:58,130
我也不会屈服的
And neither will I.

1213
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:01,120
是我们发现了你  我们把你接纳为我们的一员
We found you. We embraced you as our own.

1214
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,320
你们绑架了我
You stole me.

1215
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:06,120
让我远离家乡  家人  朋友
From my home, my family, my friends.

1216
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:16,040
你的努力真是可爱
It's cute how hard you try.

1217
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,270
但记住
But remember...

1218
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:22,230
没有我们
without us...

1219
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,680
放弃吧  卡罗尔
Give it up, Carol.

1220
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:25,860
别起来了
Stay down!

1221
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,350
你是弱小的
...you're weak.

1222
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,890
你开太快了  你得慢点
You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

1223
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:30,740
你是不完美的
You're flawed.

1224
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,630
你是想害死自己吗
Are you trying to kill yourself?

1225
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,170
无助的
Helpless.

1226
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:36,030
你太情绪化  好弱
You're too emotional and so weak.

1227
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,670
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

1228
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,570
是我们救了你
We saved you.

1229
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,370
-控制住  -我说了  卡罗尔
- Control it. - I told you, Carol.

1230
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:42,560
他们绝不会让你飞的
They'll never let you fly.

1231
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,680
这不是小姑娘的游戏
This ain't a game for little girls.

1232
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,770
你吻技好生硬
You kiss like a horse.

1233
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:46,780
你一周都坚持不住  丹弗斯
You won't last a week, Danvers.

1234
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,850
没有我们  你只是人类
Without us, you're only human.

1235
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:54,630
你说对了
You're right.

1236
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,490
我只是人类
I'm only human.

1237
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,330
在哈拉上  你重生了  成为了
On Hala, you were reborn...

1238
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:36,900
弗斯
Vers.

1239
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:45,000
我叫卡罗尔
My name is Carol.

1240
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:01,450
她想挣脱出来
She's trying to break out.

1241
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:48,760
我一直绑着一只手作战
I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back.

1242
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,520
但如果我
But what happens when...

1243
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,310
终于挣脱开会怎样
I'm finally set free?

1244
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,950
你知道你在发光吧
You know you're glowing, right?

1245
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:41,230
回头解释
I'll explain it later.

1246
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:44,980
拿走宇宙魔方
Take the Tesseract.

1247
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:46,330
留下午餐盒
Leave the lunchbox.

1248
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:47,840
-我吗  -对
- Me? - Yes.

1249
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,410
我可不碰那玩意
I'm not touching that thing.

1250
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:51,070
要我给你找副防热手套吗
You want me to get you an oven mitt?

1251
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,060
带斯库鲁人上夸式战斗机飞走
Get the Skrulls on the Quadjet and go.

1252
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:08,950
带上噬元兽
Take the Flerken with you.

1253
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,630
-那你呢  -我给你们争取时间
- What about you? - I'll buy you some time!

1254
01:33:13,290 --> 01:33:15,190
我要把你抱起来了
I'm picking you up now.

1255
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:20,930
我相信你不会吃了我
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

1256
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,500
你们好啊
Guys.

1257
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:32,730
为宇宙魔方掰腕子啊
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1258
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,530
我以前还觉得你挺逗
I used to find you amusing.

1259
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,820
我们做个了结吧
Let's put an end to this.

1260
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:15,850
好吧
Okay.

1261
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,220
乖喵喵
Good kitty.

1262
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:05,360
你一直都知道
You knew all along.

1263
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:08,030
所以我们才从不一起玩吗
Is that why we never hung out?

1264
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:09,520
不  我就是不喜欢你
No, I just never liked you.

1265
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:18,440
来啦
Incoming!

1266
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:27,270
着什么急
In a hurry?

1267
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:30,550
别逼我这么做
Don't make me do this.

1268
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:32,130
那好
Okay.

1269
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:49,320
快点  吃了他们
Come on, do your thing!

1270
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:51,480
来啊
Come on!

1271
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:54,990
来啊
Come on!

1272
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,310
真是的  咕咕
Damn it, Goose.

1273
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,010
选好边吧
Pick a side.

1274
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,570
把他们也带去机库
Take them to the hangar, too.

1275
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:08,740
我们把他们都丢进太空
We'll blast them all into space.

1276
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:12,200
别激动
Play it cool.

1277
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:14,920
就像在哈瓦那时那样
Just like Havana.

1278
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,900
你拿到那东西了吗
Do you have the thing?

1279
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,380
被噬元兽猫吃了
Flerken kitty ate it.

1280
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:35,050
快走
Come on, move!

1281
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:36,210
快走
Move!

1282
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:38,220
看我的行事
Follow my lead.

1283
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:43,850
遮住她的眼睛
Cover her eyes.

1284
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:53,510
上船
Onto the ship!

1285
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:54,910
快走  快走
Let's go! Let's go!

1286
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,160
好个移花接木
Nice diversion.

1287
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,460
我真以为我放进去了
I could have swore I put it in there.

1288
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:21,670
米涅瓦  开战机击落他们
Minn-Erva, take them down in the drop ship.

1289
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:22,730
好的
On it.

1290
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,630
你没事吧  朋友
You all right, friend?

1291
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:31,510
好极了
Never better.

1292
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,180
有敌机追来了
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1293
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:18,870
好啊
Yes!

1294
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:41,440
那是什么鬼
What the hell was that?

1295
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,970
发射弹道导弹弹头
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1296
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,570
这不可能
That's impossible.

1297
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,080
C53没有能摧毁我们弹头的
C-53 doesn't have a defense system

1298
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,840
足够先进的防御系统
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

1299
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:09,840
那不是他们的防御系统  罗南
That's not their defense system, Ronan.

1300
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,430
干掉她
Take her down.

1301
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:27,720
回跳跃点
Return to the jump point.

1302
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:30,840
我们改日再回来带走武器
We'll be back for the weapon.

1303
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:33,690
能量核吗
The core?

1304
01:43:35,690 --> 01:43:36,730
是她
The woman.

1305
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:26,430
我真为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1306
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:29,740
自那天
You've come a long way

1307
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:32,130
我在湖边发现你  你进步了好多
since I found you that day by the lake.

1308
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:34,470
但你能克制住你的情绪
But can you keep your emotions in check

1309
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:36,280
直到打败我吗
long enough to take me on?

1310
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,510
还是你仍会如以往那样被情绪左右
Or will they get the better of you as always?

1311
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:42,790
我一直对你说
I always told you...

1312
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,130
等你可以
you'll be ready

1313
01:44:44,130 --> 01:44:47,020
凭自身实力打倒我  你就真准备好了
the day you can knock me down as yourself.

1314
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:48,700
这一刻终于来了
This is that moment.

1315
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,100
这就是见分晓的时刻  弗斯
This is that moment, Vers!

1316
01:44:51,290 --> 01:44:52,860
停下那些花里胡哨的
Turn off the light show...

1317
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:56,530
向我证明  你可以光明正大地打败我...
and prove to me you can beat me without...

1318
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:13,430
我不用向你证明什么
I have nothing to prove to you.

1319
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:31,230
目的地  哈拉
Destination: Hala.

1320
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,260
我不能空手而归
I can't go back empty-handed.

1321
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:34,820
你不会空手而归
You won't be empty-handed.

1322
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:36,850
我会让你带句话回去
I'm sending you with a message.

1323
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,400
告诉至高智慧  我会去终结一切
Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I'm coming to end it.

1324
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:44,430
战争  谎言  所有一切
The war. The lies. All of it.

1325
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,150
你不能那么做
You can't do this.

1326
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:08,800
真悬啊  是吧  咕咕
That was a close call, huh, Goosey?

1327
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:12,690
那些坏蛋还在你里面吗
Those bad guys still in there somewhere?

1328
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:14,890
我的噬元兽啊
Mother Flerken!

1329
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:16,220
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You okay? - Yeah.

1330
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:17,740
就是抓了一下而已
It's just a scratch.

1331
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:19,530
不
No.

1332
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:30,480
真不敢相信你卷入了一场最酷的肉搏战
I can't believe you got in the raddest dogfight ever...

1333
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,500
而我没看到
and I missed it.

1334
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,350
要我说  你到的正是时候
I'd say you arrived just in time.

1335
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:35,630
你飞得真的很漂亮
Some nifty flying you did out there.

1336
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:37,950
神盾局总是需要你这样的好飞行员
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use a good pilot like you.

1337
01:46:37,950 --> 01:46:39,460
我会考虑的
I'll consider it...

1338
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,630
只要你不再说我的飞行"漂亮"
as long as you never call my flying "nifty" again.

1339
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:44,350
你的眼睛怎么样了
How's your eye?

1340
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:46,320
每秒都在愈合
Getting better every second.

1341
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,770
我想问清楚
Just so I'm clear...

1342
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:49,490
索拉
you were Soh-Larr...

1343
01:46:49,490 --> 01:46:51,990
-和那个神盾特工都是你  -凯勒
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent? - Keller.

1344
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:54,680
他把我上司绑了起来  盗用了他的身份
He tied my boss up, stole his identity.

1345
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:57,690
我只是借了他的脸  我不是贼
I borrowed his likeness. I'm no thief.

1346
01:46:57,690 --> 01:46:59,180
是有点像盗窃
It is a little like stealing.

1347
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,780
你是谁那边的
Whose side are you on here?

1348
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,500
你康复前都可以在这里养伤
You're good to go here until you recover...

1349
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:05,540
但你和你家人得换副新模样
but you and your family are gonna need a new look.

1350
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:07,550
我可以继续做你上司
I could go back to being your boss.

1351
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:08,440
千万别
Please don't.

1352
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:11,500
怎么了  我喜欢他那双漂亮的蓝眼睛
Come on. I loved sporting his beautiful blue eyes.

1353
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,940
说什么呢  你们的眼睛最漂亮了
No way. You guys have the best eyes.

1354
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:16,220
-永远别变你的眼睛  -她的眼睛是很美
- Don't ever change your eyes. - She has beautiful eyes.

1355
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:17,150
多谢你了
That's very sweet of you.

1356
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:19,160
我想努力不慌乱
I was trying not to panic...

1357
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:21,050
我会帮你们找到家的
I'll help you find a home.

1358
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,810
完成玛威尔的心愿
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1359
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:27,500
他们可以跟我们住这儿
They can stay here with us.

1360
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,660
不是吗  妈妈
Can't they, Mom?

1361
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:31,100
他们在这里不安全的  宝贝
They won't be safe here, baby.

1362
01:47:31,870 --> 01:47:33,280
卡罗尔阿姨是对的
Auntie Carol's right.

1363
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:35,120
他们得有自己的家
They need their own home.

1364
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,610
我很快就会回来
I'll be back before you know it.

1365
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:41,210
或许我可以飞上天  跟你碰头
Or maybe I could fly up and meet you halfway?

1366
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:44,030
那你得学会像卡罗尔阿姨那样发光
Only if you learn to glow like your Auntie Carol.

1367
01:47:44,030 --> 01:47:45,880
或许我可以建艘飞船
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.

1368
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,960
-你又说不准  -是啊
- You don't know. - He doesn't.

1369
01:47:57,390 --> 01:47:59,690
把宇宙魔方留在地球上
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1370
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:01,440
藏好
Hidden.

1371
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:03,690
你确定那是马威会想要的吗
You sure that's what Marvel would want?

1372
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:05,640
是玛威尔
Mar-Vell.

1373
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:07,010
我就那么说的
That's what I said.

1374
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:09,640
是两个词  玛  威尔
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1375
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:10,960
玛威尔
Mar-Vell.

1376
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,190
"马威"听上去好多了
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1377
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:13,900
就像惊艳合唱团
You know, like the Marvelettes.

1378
01:48:27,530 --> 01:48:28,750
没印象吗
Not ringing any bells?

1379
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,650
继续唱  或许我会想起来
Keep singing. Maybe it'll come back to me.

1380
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:47,450
我给它升级了
I upgraded it.

1381
01:48:48,090 --> 01:48:50,950
信号范围能至少覆盖几个星系了
Range should be a couple galaxies, at least.

1382
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:55,650
怎么  你觉得我会给你打骚扰电话吗
What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?

1383
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:58,820
仅限紧急情况
For emergencies only, okay?

1384
01:49:05,230 --> 01:49:06,280
好吧
Well...

1385
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,980
如果你再路过这个星系
if you're ever passing back through this galaxy...

1386
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:10,780
务必喊我一声
be sure to give a brother a shout.

1387
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:29,560
我们洗干净了番茄酱的污迹
We got the ketchup stain off.

1388
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,860
谢谢  捣蛋中尉
Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

1389
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:48,210
我也不愿意道别
It's hard for me to say goodbye, too.

1390
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:03,640
去吧
Go on.

1391
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:12,280
很高兴你回来了  长官
Glad to have you back, sir.

1392
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:13,870
这是寄给您的
This came for you.

1393
01:51:18,450 --> 01:51:19,670
是真的吗
So, is it true?

1394
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:22,090
克里人烧毁了你的眼睛
That the Kree burned your eye out...

1395
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:24,370
因为你不肯交出宇宙魔方
because you refused to give them the Tesseract?

1396
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:29,520
我既不能承认也不能否认这种说法
I will neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story.

1397
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,600
明白
Understood.

1398
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:32,850
很遗憾
I'm sorry to report

1399
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:34,410
我们仍尚未找到宇宙魔方
that we still haven't found the Tesseract.

1400
01:51:34,410 --> 01:51:36,350
它肯定会出现的
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

1401
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:39,660
等出现了我会通知您的
I'll let you know when it does.

1402
01:51:40,010 --> 01:51:41,100
然后呢
Then what?

1403
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:43,240
长官
Sir?

1404
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:47,470
我们完全不知道还存在怎样的跨星系威胁
We have no idea what other intergalactic threats are out there.

1405
01:51:47,570 --> 01:51:49,660
而我们的单人女子保安
And our one-woman security force

1406
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:53,010
还要优先处理宇宙另一边的问题
had a prior commitment on the other side of the universe.

1407
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:57,990
单靠神盾局不足以保护我们
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can't protect us.

1408
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:01,130
我们需要找到更多的
We need to find more.

1409
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,630
更多武器吗
More weapons?

1410
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:04,370
更多英雄
More heroes.

1411
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:06,260
你觉得还能找到其他她这样的人
You think you can find others like her?

1412
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:08,570
我们找到了她  而且还是没在找的时候
We found her, and we weren't even looking.

1413
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:11,450
休息一下吧  长官
Get some rest, sir.

1414
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:14,320
你要做个重要决定呢
You got a big decision to make.

1415
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:15,030
这真是场噩梦
This is a nightmare.

1416
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:18,880
我做的噩梦都比这强
I've had better nightmares.

1417
01:55:23,470 --> 01:55:25,780
那玩意停了
So, that thing just stopped doing

1418
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:27,540
虽然也不知它在干什么
whatever the hell it was doing.

1419
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:30,370
什么情况
What do we got?

1420
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:34,580
它在发送的信号终于停止了
Whatever signal it was sending finally crapped out.

1421
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:36,050
我们不是外接了电池吗
I thought we bypassed the battery.

1422
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:36,880
是的
We did.

1423
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,900
电还插着呢  它就是停了
It's still plugged in. It just stopped.

1424
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:42,070
重启  再发一次信号
Reboot it. Send the signal again.

1425
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:44,070
我们都不知道这是什么
We don't even know what this is.

1426
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,390
弗瑞知道  照做吧
Fury did. Just do it, please.

1427
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:48,800
一有信号就告诉我
You tell me the second you get a signal.

1428
01:55:49,490 --> 01:55:51,680
我想知道接收信号的人是谁
I wanna know who's on the other end of that thing.

1429
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:56,130
弗瑞人呢
Where's Fury?
